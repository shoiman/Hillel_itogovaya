Coursework
The task is to develop a classifier (convolutional neural network) 
for recognition images containing people and not containing people.
In this coursework were used 2 algorithms, which are represented in the files: 'itog' and 'new'.

In the file 'itog' I used the model RESNET34. Processing was very slow,
Acc & Loss on the Train_data gave a good result, but Acc & Loss on the Test_data gave a bad result.

In the file 'new' I used the model and data training from the article:

The model learnt quickly, Acc & Loss on the Train_data and Test_data gave good result.
